# AMCS-wdeps
A mini keybind cheat sheet for your convinience.
Note that you will need some other mods in order for stuff to work correctly, nothing game breaking tho.
# Keybinds
6 - calls in quite a few party members, i'll add this mod as a dependency in order for it to work as intended
7 - gets rid of them, plus if you have a solo quest you can just press it and party will be auto disbanded, saves time
8 - freezes time in such way so you can cast combat arts without game being frozen/softlocked. Basically timewalker 2.0, code is also written by 2767mr
9 - resets time flow to normal
# Plans
Adding a keybind to open map without having to go through the way of holding shift and clicking the button and skip intro loading.
